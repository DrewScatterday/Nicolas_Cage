# My first Deep Learning project - A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies images of Nicolas Cage 

* Source code is listed in the Nic_Cage_SourceCode.ipynb 
* Explanation of concepts like Convolution, Maxpooling, and backpropagation are explained in the Nic_Cage_Explanation.ipynb
* Jupyter_Images contains the visual aids used in the explanation notebook to explain concepts 
* Dataset contains the images used for training the classifier. It contains 2 classes. Class0 being the random "not Nicolas Cage" images and Class1 being the images of Nicolas Cage. 
* Predict contains some funny Nicolas Cage memes used for testing out our classifier after it's been trained
